# SIMPLE-ETL-PROCESS
Simple ETL (Extract, Transform and Load) using MATLAB 
# Extraction:
This step involves reading data from various sources, which can include text files, databases, web services, APIs, and more. In your case, you mentioned reading text files.

# Transformation: 
After extracting the data, you perform various operations and calculations on it to clean, format, and structure it in a way that is suitable for your analysis or reporting needs. This may include data cleansing, aggregations, filtering, and calculations.

# Loading:
Once the data is transformed and prepared, it is loaded into the destination system, which, in your case, is an Excel (xl) file. Loading can involve appending or replacing data in the Excel file, creating new sheets, or updating existing ones.

ETL processes can be implemented using various tools and programming languages, depending on your specific requirements. Common tools for ETL include Apache Nifi, Apache Spark, Talend, Microsoft SSIS (SQL Server Integration Services), Python with libraries like Pandas, and many others.

In the context of Excel, you might use a library or module to generate Excel files programmatically, such as the "openpyxl" library in Python or Excel automation features in languages like VBA (Visual Basic for Applications) if you are working within the Microsoft Excel environment.
